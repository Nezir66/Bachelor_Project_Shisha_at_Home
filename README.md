# Bachelor_Project_Shisha_at_Home

For many people it is not possible, be it because of an illness or a physical restriction, to go to a bar to smoke a shisha and hang out with friends. Precisely for these people, a barrier-free shisha delivery service web shop with additional game functions will be created in the course of this project. On the website, potential customers, with or without physical restrictions, can order a shisha on the one hand and special drinks on the other. The ordered shisha then stays with the customer for a certain period of time and is then picked up by the employees.

For special discounts, unique games are developed where customers can get discounts by finishing these games. A total of two games will be programmed, which will then have different difficulty levels. The higher the difficulty level, the better the rewards will be.

For special parties/events where many people gather, there will also be a calculator, which calculates how many water pipes you need for the planned number of people.
